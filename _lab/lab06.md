Goals
=====

Learning objectives. At the end of this lab, students should be able to:

-  Implement the visitor design pattern (part 2)
-  compute various statistics for collections (part 2) <Pearson Correlation>
-  Extra credit (extension) - add other regional data

Orientation
============
At this point, we have a fairly complex program to read in regional data (demographic and hospital) and aggreagate that data to various levels (county and state).  
We have considered extremums of the data and sorted the data and to understand the data, we can use some statistical methods to report information about the data.
Specifically, computing the correlation coefficient between two variables can indicate whether there is a relationship between those data vairables.
