Goals
=====

Learning objectives. At the end of this lab, students should be able to:

-   read and understand base C++ code (related to reading data from CSV file (all lab01))
-   Use STL hashmaps to aggregate 'county' level data to 'state' data
- 	Design and implement a C++ class representing state demographic data
- 	Extend C++ class to support additional data and methods
-   Utilize data aggregated into a hashmap to answer questions about the data (e.g. state with the youngest population)
-   (gradescope test?)

Step by Step
============

Step 0: Getting Started
-----------------------

### Download base code

Step 1: Add comments to show understanding of code
-----------------------

### Add header comments to the following files:

Step 2: Design and Implement class to represent 'state' data
-----------------------
### Design and Implement class to represent 'state' data

Step 3: Design and Implement solution to aggregate data (STL hashmap)
-----------------------
### Create and propogate data into hashmap to aggregate county data to state data

Step 4: Use data represenation (STL hashmap) to answer queries about data
-----------------------
### (e.g. state with the youngest population)
