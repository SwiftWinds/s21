Goals
=====

Learning objectives. At the end of this lab, students should be able to:

-  Revise and modify the implementation of existing code to lift shared data and members to parent class(es) (implement inheritance to simplify our existing code base)
-  Reduce redundancy in code by using inheritance (including re-write parse.cpp to reduce redundant type dependent portions)
-  Use inheritance to design types (without redundancy) to aggregate data to correct regional level ( in addition to the code to aggregate to state level also use STL and region1->region2 hashmap to create regional data at various levels)
-  Caompare data at various regional levels
