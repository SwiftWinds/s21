Goals
=====

Learning objectives. At the end of this lab, students should be able to:

- read example C++ code and understand the data representations used in the base code
- design and implement a new class to represent police shootings (which supports aggregation and comparisons)
- use a new data representation for racial demographics
- aggregate regional data to state level data using a hashmap
- implement various *compare predicates* to sort regional data and state demographic data on various data fields 
*for example, list the t... and print out the demographic data for these states or list the 5 states with the least number of people below the poverty line and the associated regional information
